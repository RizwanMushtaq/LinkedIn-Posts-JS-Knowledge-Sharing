#javascript : Temporal dead zone - Interview Question for Beginners

let x;
console.log(x)

console.log(y)
let y;

If you run above code in browser console, It will show below output:

undefined
Uncaught ReferenceError: y is not defined
  at <anonymous>:5:13

Can you explain why above output is shown?

Well, It tests you concepts above:
-> let keyword
-> difference between let and var
-> understanding about temporal dead zone in javascript

Coming back to output of above code, it is very well explained by mdn-web-docs (links in comment section) as:

Temporal dead zone (TDZ)
let variables cannot be read/written until they have been declared. If no initial value is specified on declaration, the variable is initialized with a value of undefined. Accessing the variable before the declaration results in a ReferenceError.

So, to understand it better, just open browser console of your browser now and copy paste above code and play around.
