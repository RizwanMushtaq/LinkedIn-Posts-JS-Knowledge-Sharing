#javascript : JavaScript Interview Question for beginners !!!
What is difference between var and let keywords?

Well we all know basics, but I will try to explain it how actually it is working in behind the scenes.

Basics:
var -> functional scope
let -> block scope

there is little trick while working with global scope. If you are defining var in global scope, how it is handled by browser:

//global scope
var x = 10;
console.log(window.x) //10

let y = 100;
console.log(window.y) //undefined
console.log(y) //100

if you do it like this:
console.log(window)
🟢  you see x variable is attached to window object but y variable is not attached to window object...

var -> variables are stored in global memory and attached in window object
🟢  let-> variables are not attached to window object. They are managed in separate storage.

Now moving to another concept, which is called as shadowing.

you can declare variables with same names inside and outside of functions and blocks and how they behave. Try to test these concepts in code, you will learn a lot instead of just reading this post.😊
