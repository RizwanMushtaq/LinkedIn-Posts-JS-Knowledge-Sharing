#javascript : What is higher-order function?

A function that takes function as an argument 
or
A function that returns a function
-> is called as higher-order function.

e.g.
function x(){
    console.log("Rizwan")
}

function y(x){
    x()
}

x()  ->  callback function
y()  ->  higher-order function

There are in-built javascript higher order functions:
.map()
.forEach()
.filter()
.reduce()

Now you will ask me, how these array methods are higher-order functions?
Yes, the idea is we pass function as parameter to these methods written above and return our desired results.
 
e.g.
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const newArray = numbers.map((number) => number + 1);

I hope it makes a some sense...
