#javascript : Objects as refenerce?

Refenerce Type or Value Type,

This concept is essential to learn any programming language and its memory management system, how it deals with variables defined in the code.

-> In JavaScript, a primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods or properties. There are 7 primitive data types: string, number, bigint, boolean, undefined, symbol, and null.

-> Primitives are value Types.

-> object type in JavaScript is a refenerce type.

Now I will try to explain how value types work:

console.log("strings")
let a = "hello"
let b = "hello"

console.log(a === b) // return true
Why? -> The answer is simple JavaScript checks the value of the variables, if they are equal are not

let c = a;
console.log( c === a) // return true

a = "world"
console.log(c) //return hello

----------------------------

Now moving towards objects:

console.log("Objects")
let fruit = {name: 'apple'}
let fruitbear = {name: 'apple'}

console.log(fruit === fruitbear) // return false
Why? -> The answer is although values of both objects are same but the JavaScript engine compares the reference of two variables, which is different so its false.

let fruitCopy = fruit;
console.log(fruitCopy === fruit) // return true

fruit.name = 'banana'
console.log(fruitCopy) // return {name: "banana"}

If you are still confused, you need to understand what variable is and what reference is?

variable name -> it is just a title as title on any any box
variable value -> it is actual content stored in variable
variable refernce -> it is actual place in the memory where the variable is stored

Please correct if I went wrong somewhere in explanation.
I will add links in the comment section for further reading.
